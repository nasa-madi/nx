##  Overview

The MADI project represents a groundbreaking initiative aimed at revolutionizing how we visualize and interact with digital infrastructure data, specifically tailored for aerospace applications. Sponsored by NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate and the Convergent Aeronautics Solutions Project, this project seeks to harness the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline the analysis and management of vast datasets, emerging trends around the world, and future "wicked" problems facing humanity.  

This repo is the core API of the MADI system.  By developing a shared platform that integrates AI capabilities from OpenAI with a robust core API framework provided by Feathers v5, MADI aims to reduce the infrastructure burden on for new teams and customized prompt engineering.  This API is available for expansion through plugins.  See the Tools section for more information.

##  Features


The MADI-API project provides the following features:

1. Authentication and Authorization: The API supports authentication and authorization using the `@feathersjs/authentication` package. It includes strategies for Google Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) authentication and user management with role-based access control (RBAC). The API enforces user abilities and permissions defined in the `@casl/ability` library.

2. Database Management: The API connects to a PostgreSQL database using the Knex.js query builder library. It includes database migrations and seed files to manage the database schema and populate it with initial data. The database connection configuration is stored in the `knexfile.js` file.

3. RESTful API Endpoints: The API exposes RESTful endpoints for various resources, including users, documents, chats, chunks, uploads, and tags. It follows the OpenAPI specification for documenting the endpoints and includes security definitions and response schemas.

4. Service Architecture: The API is structured using a service-oriented architecture. Each resource has its own service module that handles CRUD operations and business logic. The services follow a common structure and implement hooks for authentication, validation, and error handling.

5. Data Validations and Schemas: The API includes data validation using the Ajv library and defines schemas and validators for each resource. It ensures that the input data and query parameters conform to the specified schema and enforces data consistency.

6. Error Handling and Logging: The API includes hooks and middleware for error handling and logging. It logs errors using the Winston library and provides customizable error messages and error codes for different scenarios.

7. Test Suite: The API includes a test suite for unit testing the endpoints, services, and utility functions. It uses the Mocha test framework, Chai assertion library, and Supertest library for making HTTP requests.

8. Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD): The API includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy-cloudrun.yml`) for automated deployment to Google Cloud Run. It builds and deploys the application when changes are pushed to the main branch.

9. Documentation: The API includes API documentation generated from the OpenAPI specification. It provides detailed information about the available endpoints, their request/response structures, and examples.

10. Custom Plugins and Tools: The API includes custom plugins and tools, such as a tool for retrieving the current weather using OpenWeather API and a tool for searching scholarly articles using the Semantic Scholar API. These plugins are organized in the `src/plugin-tools` directory.

11. Extensibility and Modularity: The API is designed to be extensible and modular. It follows best practices for organizing code and provides clear separation of concerns between different modules and components.

12. Contribution Guidelines: The API includes contribution guidelines and a code of conduct for contributors. It encourages community participation through pull requests, discussions, and issue reporting.

Please refer to the [README.md](./README.md) file for more information on the project structure, installation, and how to get started with the API.

## **Connecting to an IAP-Protected API on GCP**

To securely connect to an API protected by Google Cloud's Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP), follow these detailed steps to authenticate requests using a service account or user-managed identity. This guide assumes that you have already set up IAP to protect your API and have appropriate permissions configured for accessing the resource.

#### **1. Setting Up Environment Variables**

First, define the environment and client ID variables that you will use in your authentication requests. These variables are essential for acquiring an authentication token and for making API requests to the IAP-protected service.

```shell
gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
gcloud iap oauth-brands list
```

This will respond with something like:
```
name: projects/[PROJECT_NUMBER]/brands/[BRAND_ID]
applicationTitle: [APPLICATION_TITLE]
supportEmail: [SUPPORT_EMAIL]
orgInternalOnly: true
```
Next, copy the projects and brands link and run the following command

```shell
gcloud iap oauth-clients list projects/351312167908/brands/351312167908
```

You should see a response like the following

```
name: projects/[PROJECT_NUMBER]/brands/[BRAND_NAME]/identityAwareProxyClients/[CLIENT_ID]
secret: [CLIENT_SECRET]
displayName: [NAME]
```

Now you have sufficient information to generate a token.  Use the `[CLIENT_ID]` and the right env variables below.

```shell
ENV="dev"  #or 'test' or 'prod'
DOMAIN="example.app" # or simliar domain where the app is hosted
CLIENT_ID="XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com"
TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token --audiences=$CLIENT_ID)
```

- **ENV**: This variable represents the deployment environment (e.g., `dev`, `prod`). Adjust it according to your specific environment names.
- **DOMAIN**: This variable represents the domain that you will be connecting to through IAP.
- **CLIENT_ID**: This is the client ID associated with the IAP. You can find this ID in your Google Cloud Console under the IAP section.
- **TOKEN**: This command generates an identity token for the specified client ID using the currently authenticated gcloud session. Ensure your gcloud is authenticated with a user or service account that has permission to access the IAP-protected resource.

#### **2. Verify Service Account or User Access**

Before making broader API calls, verify that the service account or user has the necessary permissions and can authenticate through IAP by creating a test user. This step confirms that your setup can successfully post data to the IAP-protected API.  For more information [see instructions here](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/programmatic-oauth-clients)

```shell
curl --location --request POST "https://$ENV.$DOMAIN/api/users/" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
--data '{}'
```

- This `curl` command makes a POST request to the API to create a new user.  If the users exists for the provided token it will error and say that you cannot create new users.
- It uses the Bearer token obtained in the previous step for authentication.
- Ensure that there is no trailing whitespace or additional characters that might break the header formatting or the URL.

#### **3. General Usage of Token**

After successfully verifying that the token works for a simple POST request, you can use the same method to authenticate other types of requests to the API. Adjust the HTTP method and endpoint according to the specific actions you need to perform.  For example, here's a request that lists the available tools (provided by plugins):

```shell
curl --location "https://$ENV.$DOMAIN/api/tools" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### **Best Practices and Troubleshooting**

- **Token Expiry**: Be aware that the tokens generated are temporary. For long-term operations, ensure your application can handle token renewal.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your code to manage and log errors returned by the IAP or the API.
- **Security Practices**: Keep your client IDs and service account credentials secure. Avoid hard-coding sensitive information directly in your application's source code.

This setup ensures that your applications can securely access APIs protected by Google's Identity-Aware Proxy using authenticated tokens that verify the identity and permissions of the requester.


## **Connecting to the Database Directly**

The easiest way to connect to the database is through a bastion host.  The commands for this can be fetched from the terraform output with the following command:

```shell
cd ../terraform
terraform workspace select <ENV> #develop #test #production
terraform output
```

You must be in the `/terraformm` folder of the main `/madi` project and must have permissions to run the terraform.
